## This is a markdown file 

This is my first R Markdown document for the first project of Data Scientist with R Course in Coursera. 
I have learned that the embed an R code chunk for printing the Hello World is as below:

```{r}
print("Hello World")
```

When you want to build another type of output string or number, you can still use the same command, try below code:

```{r}
print("Hello World from the other side")
print(123)
```

thank you..
